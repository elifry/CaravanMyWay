# Caravan My Way

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rimworld-1.4%20%7C%201.5-brightgreen.svg)

Control exactly who carries what during caravan formation!

## What does it do?

Ever been frustrated when you really wanted your pawns to carry certain items but they get loaded into the pack animal instead? Or ever add pawns to the caravan just for loading items only for them to carry items in their own inventory, defeating the purpose? This mod lets you decide exactly who carries what after you have already started forming a caravan.

- Pick which pawn carries each item
- See current and max carry weights (45/130)
- Smart UI greys out pawns who are full or can't carry more
- Works with vanilla stack splitting

## Required Mods

- None! Works with base game

## Compatible With

- Pretty much everything
- Doesn't modify core caravan code
- Just adds new UI options on left click

## How to Use

1. Start forming a caravan like normal
2. Click items you want to take
3. Pick which pawn should carry it
4. That's it!
